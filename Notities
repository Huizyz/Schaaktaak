Board problems:

problem 1
During the 1st round when pressing on an empty square, the game crashes.

problem 2
When pawn reaches the the last row and player decides to click on said pawn,
the following error occurs and the board gets expanded and scales its self
Error: "QPixmap::scaled: Pixmap is a null pixmap".

Somehow the black pawn creates another White king outside of the board
only when selected and only for said duration.

problem 3
game does not end when king gets eaten; implement game over function.

problem 4
king can move onto dangerous squares, check if this has to be fixed

Pawn:
when first moving knight above pawn if pawn hasnt moved yet it can jump over it
